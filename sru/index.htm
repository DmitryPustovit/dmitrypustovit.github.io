          *Written From a Female POV*
Short black hair. Beautiful brown eyes. He had a small scar on his cheek from a childhood accident. He was smarter then he looked, and always had a smile on his face. He was kind, kinder than anyone I've ever met. He was my best friend. He cared about me. We had an unbreakable bond. 
He was a year older then me, and had just graduated. I remember that day. With a beautiful dark blue cap and gown on, diploma in hand, and a slightly saddening smile on his face, he told me he was leaving. He wanted to see what was out there and was going to travel all over the world. No plan. No distination in mind. Wherever the road takes him. I wasn't all too suprised. I knew it was coming. As tears rolled down our faces, he promised he would keep in touch. Send postcards. Come back and take me with him after I graduated. 
And with that, he left. Going from one location to the next. One country to another. Always sending postcards and pictures everywhere he went. He looked like he was having fun, but it sounded like he was lonely from the postcards. So I started to focus. I needed to graduate and catch up to him. We were going to be together again. This time forever. 
Months passed. Slowly the postcards came less and less. I grew worried, but I still had faith. I trusted him. I knew him. If something were wrong, he wouldn't have hesitated to tell me. But as my graduation grew closer and closer, the postcards stopped coming. At first I grew scared. If something happened to him, I don't know what would have happened to me. I stopped sleeping. I would spend my nights curled up in my bed. I was lost. The only thing I could think of was my memories of him. 
I went on till graduation with a small hope that he was okay and would come back. He didn't. Months passed since graduation and not one call. Not a single letter. I eventually stopped caring. About him. About the past. About the world he went to go explore. I stopped feeling anything. I went to work, ate, and slept. All my hobbies grew boring and all my friends left me behind. It was a wonder why I was still alive. Perhaps a part of me was little hoping....
Three years passed. Nothing changed. I am still struggling to make money. Still just barely living life day by day. I have nothing. I feel nothing. And yet, for some reason, I am out here, in the middle of the forest. We used to come here often back then. Just sit on the edge of the cliff, eat snacks, talk our heart out, and watch the sunset. The memories just keep coming back. 
I slip. "Eh!?" Suddenly I'm falling. There's no way I can make this fall. I'm going to die. I'm dieing. So this is where it ends, huh? Maybe this was meant to happen. Maybe I was meant to die here. The place with the strongest memories. I close my eyes. The darkness takes over. I don't even feel myself hit the ground. 

The first thing I hear is a female voice. She's talking about chemicals or medicine or something. I slowly open my eyes. I'm laying down on a bed with a bunch of needles attached to my body. Confused, I begin to get up, only to have the women push me back against the bed. I look at her, scared. She tells me that I am in a hospital and that she's a doctor. I'm still confused. I shouldn't be alive. Noone could survive that fall. 
She sees my confused expression and explains that a man saved me. He was passing by and saw me falling and saved me. He was the one that brought me to the hospital. 
I look at the table next to me. On top of it is a card. The doctor says the man left it for me. I pick it up and look at it. It has a picture of the two of us. From the day he left. That was the last time I saw him. I flip the card over. In the middle of the card, with his handwriting, three words. I embrace the card. The never ending tears begin to flow.
