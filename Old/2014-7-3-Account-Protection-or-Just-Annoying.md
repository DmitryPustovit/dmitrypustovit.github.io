title: Account Protection or Just Annoying?
---

It seems like now days every major online retailer has their own security methods, it can be just as simple as a username and password or it can include an authorization code sent to your email. The methods vary based upon the different retailer. Usually I can suffer through the extra steps and lose 5-10 minutes and think, this will help make my account safer. However, never have I suffered through a process so irritating.

Apple is the culprit. To be more specific iTunes. I was in the need for a song so I decided to give iTunes a try. I downloaded and installed it, found the song, and logged on. It took a minutes or two as I was trying to figure out my password but what came next was simply awful. It asked me two of my security questions. Security questions in general seem pointless to me as I never remember the answer but there is usually a way to avoid them…unless you want to use iTunes. 

After a set number of guesses I decided I would try to reset them and the process for that was confusing enough and I ended up being locked out of my account for 8 hours. This was all because I wanted to use iTunes on a new computer to download a song.

It just seems like bad business because I ended up going to Amazon and buying the song in a matter of minutes. I will also not be using iTunes anytime in the future.

It seems that in today’s world simply adding things like require security questions and email authorizations are taking place of better security methods that prevent the end user from their data being stolen. 

Some may argue that those feature do prevent people being hacked and to a point I do agree. However, it shouldn’t ruin the end users experience which is what most of these feature seem to do.
