title: Using Hangouts to Call and Text on IOS
---

I recently decided I would attempt to use Google hangouts (with Google Voice integrated) for iOS to call and text, and have since still been using.

This meant a new number and free phone calls and texts using wifi or cellular data.

This is really cool as I am now able to call and text from this number not only via my phone but also my windows pc as well as any other platform that Google Hangouts support. It’s also free calling and texting and lets you do it all in a platform that saves everything via your google account.

It’s really convenient and I would recommend it to people IF it didn’t have two bugs that I experienced.  

The two downside or bugs are that contacts and notifications get screwed up. The first issue I have been having is that somehow my contacts have been duplicated in the Hangouts app. I sync my contacts from my IPhone to my Gmail so my google contacts and phone contacts are the same. Thus the result is duplicated contacts which I have yet found a method to correct, I have tried to stop sync, re installing the app, etc.

The second issue is that the notifications that appear don’t have the contact number when I receive texts. Instead it simply displays the phone number. To most people, this wouldn’t really matter as they will just go to the message and read it where the contact name is displayed. I however have a Pebble smartwatch which I read messages on, as you can imagine it is pretty important I know who sent the message.

Besides those two problems, that probably have a fix that I haven’t had time to find, it works as you would expect Phone Calls and Texts to work when sent over Wi-Fi or Cellular Data with the added bonus of being able to call and text from your computer. You can also use one number for multiple phones as the number is tied to your Hangouts and Google Voice rather than your Phone.

Oh and before any Android Fan Boys begin saying that I should just get an android which would solve all my problems, I have this to say: I am getting one.

To all the Apple Fan Boys I have this to say: I still really like the IPhone but after several years I want something new.

Lastly to any normal people who don’t care, I’m sorry I had to write a message to the Fan Boys but I just don’t want the annoying comments.
Seriously Fan Boys, no one cares…..
