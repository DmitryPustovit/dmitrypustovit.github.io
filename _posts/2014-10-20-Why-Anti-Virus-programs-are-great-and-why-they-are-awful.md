title: Anti-Virus Programs. The good. The bad.
---

I am a big supporter of antivirus programs. They just make you feel better and safer on the web. They are like a bullet proof vest against most viruses. There is no question about it, they are great because of that. However, they are also some of the most irritating things in existence. 

They work in the background to protect you from immediate threats and they scan your entire hard drive looking for the pesky viruses that hid there. Don’t get me wrong this is a good thing. 

However, the downside to this is that they require so much to do this. On a decent desktop this isn’t really noticeable. Things may slow down by a small bit but usually it isn’t enough to cause an issue. Laptops however are a whole different story. Laptops tend to heat up, slow down, and generally become quite laggy when your anti-virus decides to do a scan. 

This isn’t really avoidable but, let’s say you’re watching Netflix and you notice that the video seems to be lagging compared to the audio. You quickly deduce that it is your anti-virus that is slowing everything down and your disable it thinking, I’ll turn it on later. 

What is the result? You forget and as a result your computer is left defenseless. 

So the conclusion is that while Anti-Virus programs are amazing and a must for everyone, they come with the downside of slow performance at least once a week if you follow the scheduled scans. Sure you could plan around them or set them up at times you know you won’t be using the computer. However, in reality, who really has time for that?
