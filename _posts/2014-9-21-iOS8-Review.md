title: iOS 8 - Huge For Developers. Massive For Everyone Else.
---

This is my opinion of iOS 8 and if people should upgrade. 
I will be covering only the iPhones. It will include a lot 
of the major drawbacks to the new update. I also mention some 
of the major update and what make it pretty neat.

First of all. If you have an iPhone 4s, don't even bother. Even 
though apple says it is supported, the new iOS slows your 4s to 
almost unusable speeds. This is expected, the 4s is outdated. This 
iOS will most likely be the last update apple offers for the 4s 
although 4s owners are better off sticking with iOS 7.

Now if you own an iPhone 5, 5s, or 5c there are a lot of new 
features in this iOS that may be worth updating, if you willing 
to suffer a bit.

First of all, if you happen to have 6.8 gigabytes of free space 
then congrats, you can download the new iOS. Everyone else, time 
to get rid of all those selfies. A lot of the negative reviews 
from people are based around the massive storage requirement to 
download the update.

If you happen to be one of those brave souls that does manage to 
download and install the update then you do get to enjoy a lot of 
really cool features along with a lot really neat things that make 
you hate your phone. First of all, apple had included a lot of 
additional features to make your phone an even more important part 
of your life. 

Some of these features are: A better photo system (I didn't know 
the old one was bad...), an improved messaging system, a better design 
(a lot of little features), a better keyboard (more android), family 
sharing (I know no one who this will actually help), iCould Drive 
(hopefully this version won't be hackable), health (an health monitoring 
app, not the promise of health), better connectivity with all your other 
apple devices (useless if an iPhone is the only apple product you have...), 
spotlight (better search). The new update also comes with a ton of security 
fixes.

Now the new messaging system does look really neat. They added a lot of 
features that people wouldn't have thought they needed but do make 
using an iPhone a better experience. Of course the major point of 
this update is not the features that apple built in but the features 
that they are letting others build in. Developers are now allowed 
to access parts of the phone that change visual aspects such as 
your keyboard, navigation center, etc.

On the negative side of things. Shorter battery life, slower performance, 
messaging problems, and issues with Bluetooth connectivity have 
been reported. Sound like fun right? On the plus side, since 
the battery life is shorter you may not have a chance to 
encounter these issues.

As you can clearly tell there are a lot of positives and 
negatives to this update. If you're happy with iOS7 then 
keep it. Although a lot of apps may stop supports iOS7 as 
so many new features are given to developers in iOS8.

While this update is massive (figuratively and literary) 
it's really up to you. Take a good look at the new features 
at Apple's website and decide but how badly you want access 
to those features.
