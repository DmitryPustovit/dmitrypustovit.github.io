Recently Google has released a new email service called Inbox. This is a new service that works with a user’s Gmail account. It gives users access to a redesigned email client that is jam packed with new features. Currently it is invite only, Google’s usual approach to new services. I managed to get access and have had some time to experience it.

First impression: 
What Google has created is a system in which your email looks nicer and is much more effecient. They do this by encouraging you to keep your main Inbox empty of new emails. That said your old emails are still included, just not in the Inbox. Most of your emails should be or should be moved to the Done section. This is more of a storage vault for all of your emails. 
	*Fair warning, they go into the Done section in the order you put them in, as in the first email sent to the done section is at the very end of the list. If you want to see your recent emails first then start transferring your emails in reverse. Kind of a pain but then again there is a reason Google hasn’t released this to the public yet.*
Then there is the Snooze feature. This is a lot like the snooze feature on your alarm clock, you send the emails that you want to avoid dealing to the Snooze section. It is a rather interesting feature, it even comes with time intervals that you can snooze for. 
There are also bundles, which are truly amazing. They allow you to bundle things like promotional emails, newsletters, and other thing you wouldn’t consider super important are sorted into a section that allows you to ignore it until you have the time or you need it. 
There are a lot of little things like reminders that make it really convenient to use. Not to mention it looks just fantastic. It seems that google is trying out a new look and so far it is working! I will admit I was expecting to hate Inbox, even when I first started to use it. At first it seemed ugly, but once you adapt it is truly amazing. 

I will add onto this post once I have had more time to use it.

To close this review off I have to mention that there is a reason it is invite only. It is still in progress so there are some bug. Really they are just minor annoyances that most people would ignore.
