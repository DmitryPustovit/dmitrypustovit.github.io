title: Pi Day Math Fun: Let's Find Pi!

Its Pi day so I am obligated to do something that has to do with Pi so I decided to find Pi. I will use calculus to do this, specifically infinite series. My calculus teach should be very proud of me. I will be using two different methods, the first is the Gregory–Leibniz series which is best explained as the following:

Pi = (4/1) – (4/3) + (4/5) – (4/7) + (4/9) – (4/11) …

After 500,000 terms the first 5 decimals are correct.

Next I will be using Nilakantha's series which is similar but converges to the first five decimals much faster. It is explain as the flowing:

Pi = 3 + ( 4 / (2 * 3 * 4) ) - ( 4 / (4 * 5 * 6) ) + ( 4 / (6 * 7 * 8) ) …

This series converges much faster than the Gregory–Leibniz series.  It gets the first 5 terms after only 22 terms it converges to the first 5 decimals.
