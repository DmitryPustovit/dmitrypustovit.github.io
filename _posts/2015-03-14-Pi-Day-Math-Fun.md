title: Pi Day Math Fun

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/pi.jpg)

Its Pi day so I am obligated to do something that has to do with Pi so I decided to find Pi. I will use calculus to do this, specifically infinite series. My calculus teach should be very proud of me. I will be using two different methods, the first is the Gregory–Leibniz series which is best explained as the following:

Pi = (4/1) – (4/3) + (4/5) – (4/7) + (4/9) – (4/11) …

After 500,000 terms the first 5 decimals are correct.

Try it out:
