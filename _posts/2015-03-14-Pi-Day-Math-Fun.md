title: Pi Day Math Fun

Its Pi day so I am obligated to do something that has to do with Pi so I decided to find Pi. I will use calculus to do this, specifically infinite series. My calculus teacher should be very proud of me. I will be using two different methods.

<h1> Gregory–Leibniz Series </h1>
The first is the Gregory–Leibniz series which is best explained as the following:

Pi = (4/1) – (4/3) + (4/5) – (4/7) + (4/9) – (4/11) …

After 500,000 terms the first 5 decimals are correct.

Try it out:

<h1> Nilakantha's Series </h1>
Next I will be using Nilakantha's series which is similar but converges to the first five decimals much faster. It is explain as the following:

Pi = 3 + ( 4 / (2 * 3 * 4) ) - ( 4 / (4 * 5 * 6) ) + ( 4 / (6 * 7 * 8) ) …

This series converges to the much first 5 decimals faster than the Gregory–Leibniz series.  It gets the first 5 terms after only 22 terms it converges to the first 5 decimals.

That is it for this quick post. Go out, have some fun, and eat some pie. Happy &pi; day!
