Yes, it's finally the day.

"Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?!" - Marty Mcfly

It is today that Marty Mcfly is to arrive in our time in a time traveling DeLorean. Back to the Future part 2, part of the iconic back to the future series, showed Marty and the future. Specifically it showed today, October 21st, 2015. Forever who has seen the movie, the future it showed has many thing we have today. Of course it got it's fair share things wrong. Rather then list them all, I will simply advise you to look at the MANY other articles written by popular news outlets.

If you find yourself feeling nostalgic, go see the movies! Thatâ€™s right some movie theaters have a screening of the movie! Now if you've never seen the movie, now is a perfect time to see this amazing series.

Also it happens that one year ago, I posted my AutoBack article. You can find it [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/Autoback).
