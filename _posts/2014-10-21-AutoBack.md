This post is essentially promoting a program I wrote back in the summer called AutoBack.

AutoBack’s purpose was simply. To avoid the frustration of losing work. A common hot key that developers use is Control + S. This is to save their work in various programs. AutoBack works in the background and whenever that hot key is used it backs up a selected folder to a selected location and time stamps that folder.

I wrote this program for a competition that took place over the summer. It got into the semi-finals however, it did not progress. I entered an “Alpha Version”. 

Really it was a rushed build of the program, when it came down to it, I had to finish the build the night before. 

After the competition I got some work done on the program and seemed to have fixed a few of the issues.

You can find the project files and a few of the compiled version on its Github page located [HERE](https://github.com/dmitrypustovit/autoback)
