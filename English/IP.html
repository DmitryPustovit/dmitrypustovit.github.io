    <center> <h1> A Reflection</h1> </center>
    <center> <div style="max-width: 600px;">Despite the large amounts of technical trouble and just me doing silly stuff like forget to send an important word document, in my opinion this project turned out pretty good. I had a great time researching, mainly because it was the same thing I would do if I were just killing time. I would just surf the web and when I spotted something cool, like a NASA twitter post, I would wonder how I could use that in my Inquiry Project. Eventually, after spending enough time scattering the web, I found enough cool things to be able to make a project out of them. The most trouble I made in making my genre artifacts was determining just how to make them. I had this bundle of information and it could be used and displayed in many different ways. A part of me didn’t want to do a PowerPoint but it was nice was I could quickly show what I discovered from my major sources. Figuring out what source was useful was also a bit of a struggle, there are way too many blog articles that I just couldn’t use. Overall, I had fun but if I were to do it again I would pick a different theme.</div></center>
