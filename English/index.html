      Hello, my name is Dmitry Pustovit! I am a computer science major that also loves to build robots, go to programming competitions, and have adventures.
      <br/>
  Writing has always been like tape for me, one side does its job and sticks to stuff while the other is just awkwardly there. I enjoy writing but, when I am given a writing assignment the enjoyment quickly fades. This portfolio shows how I manage to suck it up and write some pretty interesting stuff.
  <br/>
  Another use of this portfolio is to show how I progressed as a writing thought out this course as seen from my various writings.
  <br/>
  Something kind of cool is that I hand coded this entire website, thus why it is so plain. I was planning on having something much flashier but my other classes kept me far too busy.
