          The world sees me as, in my opinion, someone a lot like Lennard from the big bang theory when it comes to personality.
      </div>
      <div class="moreText">
        I’m extremely nerdy in that I like all of the typical nerd things, Doctor Who, Science, playing roll playing games, etc. I also like robots and find theoretical physics fascinating to talk about. I am good with computers so they see me as someone they can ask for help when their computer breaks. In general they see me as the typical stereotype. I don’t really see myself as anyone besides myself.

      <div class="title"><h1> Walking Through The Forest <div class="span"> September 16, 2015 </div></h1></div>
      <div class="content">
        The sound of an owl making it mark on the sound of the forest is followed only by the forest’s natural voice. Insects buzzed as the dark sky was over head yet the forest was strangely lit by the moons light.
      </div>
      <div class="moreText">
      Water droplets fall from the leaves of the trees onto the dark grass covered ground. A small rabbit dashes though following a narrow dirt path mostly covered in leaves and fallen braches. As the rabbit’s feet hit the path, every time a small splash happens covering the small creature’s feet in a brown mud. The rabbit slows at the curve to see what is ahead, the twists and turns of the path not letting the small creature see more than what is directly ahead. As he turns his eyes and mine meet and he dashes into a dark green bush alongside the path and hurries away from me and the familiar path. Where the rabbit stood as eyes met lays a small key. With a lingering curiosity I carefully walk to the key, pick it up and carefully place it in the palm of my left hand. I rub away some of the mud and examine it closely. The key is small and rusty yet the teeth could easily open whatever lock it was meant to fit inside. I place the key in my pocket and continue along the path unintentionally following the rabbits footprints backwards. Further down the path a slight shine catches my attention. I walk over to the object laying alongside the path and discover it to be a small golden cup. I look closer to see that it is no more than a plastic cup what has been painted golden, the paint chipping off at the corners. I pay no more attention to the cup and continue along the path until a familiar sight catches my eye. A large gleaming purple tree laying across the path blocking anyone from passing. I look at the rabbit’s foot prints, which I had taken notice to earlier as I walked down the path, and notice a small path leading into the forest and connects to the path on the other side of the tree. The path is wide enough for only a small rabbit to fit but, I cautiously sidestep along the path being carefully to avoid or step over any torn covered plant or bush that may cause be harm. I quickly reach the end of the path and step back onto the main path with the fallen tree know behind me. I continue to walk down the path and a small house becomes visible. At first I stop and consider turning back but, only for a moment. Instead I shrug the slight fear that has clinched to me and proceed carefully to the house. As I arrive fear leaves me and is replace with a worry. Only a burnt frame covered in the forests beautiful green remains. The house itself is not more than a few sticks of wood supported only by the vines that have overgrown around them. Vary of my surrounding I look around and see nothing of value or interest and continue along the path until I reach the end of the path. Ahead of me is a wooden fence, barely standing as most of wooden has long since rotten. I notice the rabbit footprints come from the other side of the fence. It take no more than a minute to break enough of the fence for me to walk through. Ahead lies only tall grass green grass easily reaching top of my head, anything else is obscured by the darkness of the sky. Using the moon, I struggle to follow the rabbit’s footprints which have become my only guide through the field of darkness. The moons light is too faint in the grass, and I can see only grass ahead and the fence which I walked through is quickly obscured from my sight.

      Investing in amazon at IPO, first moment you could buy stocks, in the 1997 would give you a yield of $239,045 per $1000 dollars.
      </div>
      <div class="moreText">
       I would borrow a million, invest it into amazon stocks which would actually increase the price of the amazon stock at the given moment by a small amount. This way I would have 239+ million waiting for me. Enough to pay off the borrowed million many time over even if there was a high interest rate on this money. This would result in a large profit and would cause minimal effect as if anything it would only increase the rate at which the amazon stock would go up at. The amount would not be too significant of an amount to invest as their income at the time was 147.8 million for the year of 1997.

        Such a fine blend between metal and plastic, between dark and light. Fine cut in every way, not an edge done wrong. So light yet, not in my eyes. You bring light to even the darkest of areas. Your quiet but you made a huge impact. You never fear to stay the same, always changing what you are.

        If I could find one thing in my family’s attic it would have to be a treasure map or something along those lines.
      </div>
      <div class="moreText">
        Something that leads to adventure and mystery with tales of great reward at the end. It would have to lead to traveling around the world with me never knowing where it would lead. An adventure of a life time. Even better would be to find a map with a box that I can’t open. Only following the map would I find the key to open the box that would then have inside of it another treasure map or a clue to the treasure. I would like to find a long and complicated adventure. Perhaps even one that would lead to several more long and complicated adventure because that’s what makes life so interesting complications and adventure.

        <center> <h1> A Reflection</h1> </center>
        <center> <div style="max-width: 600px;">The daybook entries I choose are, in my opinion, kind of completely random. They were all just entries that I enjoyed writing and I didn’t hate reading. They showed a bit of every type of writing I could do. From describing items to answering questions, they showed my writing in various different stages. My experience with in class writing was quite enjoyable. I had a lot of fun discussing various topics with my friends and even when writing alone, the topic or prompt was at the very least manageable. There were a few in class writing that I simply didn’t know how to respond and ended up being rather awful but I decided to include them regardless. I tried to include in class writings in a span of time to show how my writing changed, be it for the better or worse. In my opinion however, it seems to really just depend on what it is I’m writing. Regardless, the in class writings show my progression as a writing and for some reason or another I’m happy with the ones that I have selected. </div></center>
