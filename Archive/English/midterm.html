    <center> <div style="max-width: 600px;">From this point forward, it seems that the class is goaled towards working on our website. I would structure it so that there is a short writing assignment in the beginning after which all of the time is dedicated towards building the website. When there is something due, like for example the “Summary and Annotated Bibliography for EIP”, we should spend time the class before discussing it. This continues the trend that we already follow however, the emphasis is to put most of the remaining class time towards our website for the project. </div></center>

    <center> <div style="max-width: 600px;">Personally I don’t like to write when I am given an assignment. In my free time when I have an idea, be it a blog post or a story idea, I will be glad to write. However, when I am given an assignment all enthusiasm about writing disappears. Many of our writings have been either proper papers, MLA with citations, or have been based on a question or prompt. (A lot like this one.) However, something we have gone over in this class that I believe will help me to become a better writing is the concept of a “shitty first draft.” When I write I end up spending far too much time focus on the way a sentence is worded or the way a room is described, typically this results in the loss of enthusiasm for the idea.  </div></center>
