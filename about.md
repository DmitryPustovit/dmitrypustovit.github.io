Technology is all around us in the world today. The challenge exists not to use it but to improve it.

### A Bit About Me

Programming is my passion. I also enjoy several other activities such as robot building and writing. I love sci-fi and I find myself commonly working on a ridiculous solution to a problem most people don't have.
